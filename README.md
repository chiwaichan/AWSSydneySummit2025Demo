## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- Git (optional, for cloning)

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Download the Code

**Option A: Download ZIP**
1. Click the green "Code" button on GitHub
2. Select "Download ZIP"
3. Extract the ZIP file to your desired location

**Option B: Clone with Git**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chiwaichan/AWSSydneySummit2025Demo
cd AWSSydneySummit2025Demo
```

### Step 2: Set Up Python Virtual Environment

**On Windows:**
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Required Packages

```bash
# Upgrade pip first
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Configure AWS Credentials

**Option A: AWS CLI (Recommended)**
1. Install AWS CLI: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/
2. Configure credentials:
```bash
aws configure
```
Enter your:
- AWS Access Key ID
- AWS Secret Access Key
- Default region (e.g., `us-east-1`)
- Default output format: `json`

**Option B: Environment Variables**
```bash
# On Windows (Command Prompt)
set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
set AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1

# On macOS/Linux
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

### Step 5: Enable Amazon Nova Pro

1. **Log into AWS Console**
2. **Navigate to Amazon Bedrock**
   - Search for "Bedrock" in the AWS Console
   - Click on "Amazon Bedrock"

3. **Request Model Access**
   - In the left sidebar, click "Model access"
   - Click "Request model access" or "Manage model access"
   - Find "Amazon Nova Pro" in the list
   - Click "Request access" next to it
   - Fill out the form if required
   - Wait for approval (usually instant for Nova models)

4. **Verify Access**
   - Ensure "Amazon Nova Pro" shows "Access granted" status

### Step 6: Set Up AWS IoT Core (Optional)

*Note: The app works with sample data without IoT setup*

For full IoT functionality:
1. Go to AWS IoT Core console
2. Create IoT policies with publish permissions
3. Create IoT things for your devices
4. Update topic names in `app.py` if needed

### Step 7: Run the Application

```bash
# Make sure your virtual environment is activated
# Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## Usage Guide

### AI Agent Tab (Powered by AWS Strands Agents)
- Type "tools" to see available commands
- Ask natural language questions like:
  - "Show me vehicle telemetry"
  - "Feed the cat for 3 seconds"
  - "Open the Iron Man helmet"
- Watch how Strands Agents figures out which tools to use and runs them for you

### Cat Feeder Control
- Use Forward/Stop/Backward buttons
- Set timed feeding sessions

### Vehicle Telemetry
- View real-time vehicle data
- Monitor temperature, humidity, GPS location

### Iron Man Helmet
- Control faceplate (open/close)
- Control eye lights (on/off)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"ModuleNotFoundError"**
```bash
# Ensure virtual environment is activated
# Reinstall packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**"AWS credentials not found"**
- Verify AWS credentials are configured
- Check AWS CLI with: `aws sts get-caller-identity`

**"Access denied for Nova Pro"**
- Ensure model access is granted in Bedrock console
- Wait a few minutes after approval

**"Streamlit command not found"**
```bash
# Reinstall streamlit
pip install streamlit --upgrade
```

### Getting Help

1. Check AWS CloudWatch logs for IoT errors
2. Verify your AWS region supports Nova Pro
3. Ensure IAM permissions for Bedrock and IoT Core
